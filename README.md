# 🏥 Lost Hospital Locator

## 🗣️ How This Project Came About  

Not long ago, a friend of mine who works as a health officer in Accra, Ghana reached out to me with a concern.  
*"Babs, during emergencies, people in Accra waste time trying to figure out where the nearest hospital is. There’s no simple, reliable map people can quickly check to find help. Can you build something to fix that?"*

As a GIS developer, I knew this was exactly the kind of problem I love solving.  
So I decided to put together a simple but effective interactive map that would display a set of hospital locations within Accra.

## 🎯 The Problem  

In many cities, especially in developing areas, people often don’t know where the nearest hospital or emergency service is located during a crisis.  
And in those critical moments, time wasted means lives lost.

## 💡 The Solution  

I built a lightweight, interactive web map using **Leaflet.js**, which fetches hospital locations from a GeoJSON file and plots them on a live map with clear, custom markers.  
Clicking on any marker shows a popup with the hospital’s name and details, helping people locate the nearest facility instantly.  

The map is mobile-friendly, responsive, and easy to deploy using **GitHub Pages**.
